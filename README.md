## - text classification for Korean/Korean language data, not English data. The method itself was not significantly different from the text classification for English data. However, the difference is that Korean data is used in tokenization by using a morpheme analyzer

## - The data to use this time is NAVER movie review data. Data of 200,000 reviews in total consists of text for movie reviews and 1 for positive reviews, 0 for negative reviews
